I have a bunch of college degree in mechanical engineering but  i've fell in love with web developing since almost 3 years ago  and i started to learn that by myself.  I belive that if you have enough passionate inerest and greate perseverance, selfe-study is certainly more effective than traditional education.  my special expertise is react-js and to achive that I learned a lot of things such as Html.5, CSS, JavaScript, git, redux,... . I'm  passionate to my work and always try to keep in touch with the latest informations and technics about react and web developing . "
